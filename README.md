# or
next dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
Its reccommended that you use the production link and not run it locally.

## Catalog Page
The catalog page is where users can filter the catalog by name, catagory and brand. Fill out the fields to retrieve products or leave them blank and get all products in the system.

Clicking on an item in the catalog brings you to the details page. There you can write reviews and add the product to your cart. When you make a review and click post, refresh the page to see it added to the list.

## Cart
Using the cart is simple enough. Dont worry about the number of items in your order because its unlimited. Clicking checkout brings you to the checkout page


## Some General Notes
- To login as an admin use the username: jim and password: test
- If you revisit the app after some time and features start to not work, logout and relog.
- When posting reviews refresh the page once you click send to see the review
- Searching the catalog with empty fields gets all products
- There is an unlimited number of items in the system so feel free to add as much as you want to the cart
